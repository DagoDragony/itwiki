# Vim Idea

## Search

### File search

Most effective way is `fzf` 

### In File search

* `vimgrep /searchword/ *` - runs results in quickfix(possibly listing select only 1 line, moving cnext, cprevious)
* Grepper - runs asynchronously (grep works asynchronously) and has some additional features and settings
*
