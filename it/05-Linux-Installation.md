# Linux Installation

BIOS installation is usually more reliable. To install in BIOS mode you need to set legacy boot.
If not, system will automatically use UEFI including gp table instead of MBR

* `cfdisk` - ui'ish fdisk
* `fdisk` - is old command for MBR partitions
* `gdisk` is new for gp tables, however, it includes same and more(like convertion from one format to other)
